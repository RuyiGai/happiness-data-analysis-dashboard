# 🌍 World Happiness Index Dashboard

An interactive data visualization dashboard built with Python and Dash to analyze global happiness trends and examine how different influencing factors relate to happiness levels across countries and regions over time.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores global happiness trends using data from the **World Happiness Report (2005–2023)**.  
The dashboard is designed to support interactive exploration of happiness scores across countries, regions, and years.

The analysis focuses on the following key questions:
1. Which regions exhibit higher or lower happiness levels?
2. How are different influencing factors related to the happiness index?
3. Which factors play a more significant role in countries with relatively high or low happiness levels?

Through interactive maps, scatter plots, line charts, and bar charts, users can explore both regional patterns and factor-level relationships in an intuitive and dynamic way.
